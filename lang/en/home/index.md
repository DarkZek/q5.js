## Credits 🌟

This project aims to continue the legacy of the incredible work done by [Ben Fry](https://benfry.com) and [Casey Reas](https://x.com/REAS) on Java [Processing](https://processingfoundation.org/), [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com)'s work on [p5.js](https://p5js.org), and all contributors to these projects.

The original [q5xjs (v0)](https://github.com/LingDong-/q5xjs) was created by [@LingDong~](https://github.com/LingDong-) and released under the public domain Unlicense license. We forked and significantly extended the abandoned codebase.

q5.js v2 is open source under the LGPLv3, created and actively maintained by the q5 team: [@quinton-ashley](https://github.com/quinton-ashley) and [@Tezumie](https://github.com/Tezumie).
