- up to 32x faster than p5.js 🏎️
- HDR color support 🌈
- compatible with popular addons, including [p5.sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) and [p5play](https://p5play.org) 🎮

q5.js was designed to make creative coding fun and accessible for a new generation of artists, designers, educators, and beginners. 🤝

## Blazing fast! 🚀

[Draw up to 32x more](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/wiki/Developer-Log) per frame with [q5 WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API), compared to the limits of p5. Or save battery by getting the same results with less power consumption. 🌱

Switching from p5 to q5 is like getting a free computer upgrade. 🎉

## Support q5 💙

q5 is open source and anyone can use it for free under the terms of the LGPL (just like p5.js). 🎉

We need your support though! If you enjoy using q5.js, please donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/quinton-ashley) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/q5play).

## Dynamic 🐙

Q5 instances can be created manually, which makes the `setup` function optional. Use q5 functions anywhere with [top-level global mode](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/wiki/Top%E2%80%90Level-Global-Mode)! 👀

```js
new Q5();

createCanvas(400, 400);
```

## Sound On 🔊

p5.sound is a great library, but typical use doesn't require its extensive sound generation and filtering features. 🎛️

q5.js includes sound loading, playback, and basic mixing by default. 🎚️

# 10-2

## Lightweight 🪶

p5.js and p5.sound.js have a combined size of 5.6MB! ⚠️

q5.js is <140kb, that's 98% smaller. 🌳

For extremely lightweight use, load only the features you need from the [q5 source folder](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/tree/main/src). Load q5 using script tags or as JavaScript modules. 📦

## Frame your Art 🖼️

The `displayMode` function lets you frame your art within the browser window, no CSS skills required! 📽️

Make a canvas be centered or fill the screen without clipping or changing the aspect ratio. Use the "pixelated" rendering preset to make pixel art. 👾

## Credits 🌟

This project aims to be the spiritual successor to the incredible work done by [Ben Fry](https://benfry.com) and [Casey Reas](https://x.com/REAS) on Java [Processing](https://processingfoundation.org/), [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com)'s work on [p5.js](https://p5js.org), and all contributors to these projects.

The original [q5xjs (v0)](https://github.com/LingDong-/q5xjs) was created by [@LingDong~](https://github.com/LingDong-) and released under the public domain Unlicense license. We forked and significantly extended the abandoned codebase.

q5.js v2 is open source under the LGPLv3, created and actively maintained by the q5 team: [@quinton-ashley](https://github.com/quinton-ashley) and [@Tezumie](https://github.com/Tezumie).
