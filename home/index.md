## The sequel to p5.js is here! 🎉

q5 implements all of [p5](https://p5js.org)'s 2D drawing, math, and user input functionality.

q5 a drop-in replacement that's performance optimized and lightweight (~20x smaller than p5). 👀

## More vibrant colors 🎨

p5 has no HDR support 😕

q5 automatically supports HDR 🤩

(This is what the exact same code running in p5 and q5 looks like. 🤯)

## More help with errors 🤖

JavaScript's error messages can be confusing for beginners. 🤨

p5's friendly errors are usually good, but sometimes lack detail and neglect context. 🙋

Asking AI for help is just a click away with q5's error assistance system! ✨

# 3-0

## More freedom 🔥

q5 is open source licensed under the [LGPLv3](../LICENSE.md), so you're free to use it in any project. 💸

The q5 team is dedicated to providing an inclusive community for all users. Join us on the [q5.js Discord](https://discord.gg/QuxQYwGWuB)! 🌐

## More flexible 🤹

q5.js works right out of the box with your existing p5.js sketches! 📦

But we also aim to make q5 modular, so you'll only have to load the parts you need. 🧩

# 5-0

## More organized code 📚

With q5's top-level global mode, the `setup` and `draw` functions are optional. 👀

## WebGPU support 🚀

We're already working on a next-gen version of q5 that uses WebGPU for blazing fast rendering! 🏎️

## More transparency ⚖️

The Processing Foundation receives [millions of dollars in donations](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-foundation-funding-update-94cddb25a3d9), but where does all that money go? 💸

The p5 website and code editor have [hardly changed since their release](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/hello-p5-js-web-editor-b90b902b74cf). Even when the legendary Dan Shiffman makes feature requests, they're [ignored for 7 years and counting](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/issues/208#issuecomment-263898359). Many of the proposed ["2.0" updates](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6678) to p5.js are years overdue. 📅

Volunteers are doing most of the real work. Even the most popular third party p5 library, [p5play](https://p5play.org), doesn't receive any financial support from the Foundation. Yet it still takes months for paid staff to simply approve and publish crucial updates. 🤔

Why can't staff focus on p5.js? Perhaps they're too busy [taking paychecks from other full-time jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsaber/). 🕵️

When confronted about any of this on Discord or GitHub, the p5 team ignores or bans posts by upset users, citing "verbal violence" and playing the victim. It seems they'd prefer to take their +$150k salaries in peace. 🎂

# 10-1

The q5 team aims to right these wrongs by being financially transparent, quick with useful updates, and receptive to all feedback (especially criticism). 📝

Creative coders deserve better. Let's make it happen together! 🤝
