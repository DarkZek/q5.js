## Code of Conduct

We aim to make contributing to the q5 project more approachable for non-experts by using modern JavaScript, without any complicated build tools or frameworks.

All contributors are required to check their ego at the door and be open to feedback. Critique of code is not a critique of the person who wrote it. We're all here to learn and work with others to collectively write the best code possible.

The q5 team would like to foster a pleasant, diverse community built upon a mutual desire to create art. Yet, we also welcome those with strong opinions to share them, without fear of being censored or banned.
