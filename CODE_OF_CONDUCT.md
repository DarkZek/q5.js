## Code of Conduct

We aim to make contributing to the q5 project more approachable for non-experts by using modern JavaScript without any complicated build tools or frameworks.

All contributors are required to check their ego at the door and be open to feedback. Critique of code is not a critique of the person who wrote it. We're all here to learn and work with others to collectively write the best code possible.

Code is a language art that can be subjectively judged by its effectiveness at communicating its functionality to humans. Code can also be objectively measured by its performance. Since JavaScript is served over a network, size is a factor as well. Therefore, the q5 team strives to balance code readability with brevity and performance.
